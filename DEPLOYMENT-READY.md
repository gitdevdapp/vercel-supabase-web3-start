## 🚀 Next Steps: Deploy to Vercel

### Step 1: Add GitHub Remote

```bash
# If you have an existing GitHub repository:
cd /Users/garrettair/Documents/vercel-supabase-web3-start
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
```

**Or create a new GitHub repository:**
1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Name: `vercel-supabase-web3-start` (or your choice)
3. Make it **Public** or **Private**
4. **Do NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click **Create repository**
6. Copy the remote URL shown

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push the main branch
git push -u origin main
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Enumerating objects: 502, done.
Counting objects: 100% (502/502), done.
Writing objects: 100% (502/502), 133660 lines
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (XXX/XXX), done.
To https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

### Step 3: Connect to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click **"Add New"** → **"Project"**
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. **Framework Preset:** Next.js (auto-detected) ✅
5. **Root Directory:** `./` (default)
6. **Build Command:** `npm run build` (auto-detected)
7. **Output Directory:** `.next` (auto-detected)

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables

In Vercel's environment variables section, add:

```bash
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Optional (for Web3 wallets)
CDP_API_KEY_ID=your-key-id
CDP_API_KEY_SECRET=your-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CDP_WALLETS=true
```

**Pro Tip:** You can paste your entire `.env.local` file content!

### Step 5: Deploy

Click **"Deploy"** and wait ~3-5 minutes.

**Expected Result:**
```
Building...
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (39/39)
✓ Finalizing page optimization
✓ Build Completed

Deployment ready!
```
