# 🚀 MVP Profile Page Deployment Checklist

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Security Review
✅ **Environment Variables**: No hardcoded secrets in codebase  
✅ **Database Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) enabled  
✅ **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation implemented  
✅ **Authentication**: Proper auth checks on all protected routes  
✅ **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages  

## 🔧 Supabase Database Setup

### 1. Run Database Migration
Execute the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste contents from docs/profile-setup.sql
-- This will create the profiles table with proper RLS policies
```

### 2. Verify Database Security
- [ ] Row Level Security is enabled on `profiles` table
- [ ] Users can only access their own profile data
- [ ] Trigger is set up for automatic profile creation

### 3. Test Database Connection
```bash
# Test API endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-supabase
```

## 🌐 Vercel Deployment Setup

### 1. Environment Variables in Vercel
Add these to your Vercel project settings:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 2. Supabase Auth Redirect URLs
Add these URLs in Supabase Auth settings:

**Production URLs** (replace with your domain):
```
https://your-domain.vercel.app/auth/callback
https://your-domain.vercel.app/auth/confirm
```

**Preview URLs** (for preview deployments):
```
https://your-app-name-*.vercel.app/auth/callback
https://your-app-name-*.vercel.app/auth/confirm
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Run tests: `npm test`
- [ ] Build succeeds: `npm run build`
- [ ] Lint passes: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Profile CRUD operations work locally

### After Deployment
- [ ] Authentication flow works
- [ ] Profile page loads for authenticated users
- [ ] Profile editing and saving works
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Dark/light mode switching works

## 🔒 Security Verification

### Database Security
- [ ] Test that users cannot access other users' profiles
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are working correctly
- [ ] Check that profile creation is automatic on signup

### Application Security
- [ ] No environment variables exposed in client-side code
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal system information
- [ ] Input validation prevents SQL injection attempts
- [ ] XSS protection through React's built-in escaping

## 📱 Feature Verification

### Core Features
- [ ] ✅ Profile picture (first letter avatar)
- [ ] ✅ Username display and editing
- [ ] ✅ Email display (read-only)
- [ ] ✅ About me field editing
- [ ] ✅ Responsive design
- [ ] ✅ Form validation
- [ ] ✅ Loading and error states

### User Experience
- [ ] Profile link appears in navigation for authenticated users
- [ ] Smooth transitions between view/edit modes
- [ ] Clear feedback for successful operations
- [ ] Graceful error handling and user messaging

## 🚀 Go-Live Steps

1. **Final Code Review**: Ensure all TODOs are completed
2. **Environment Setup**: Verify all environment variables
3. **Database Migration**: Run profile-setup.sql in production
4. **Deploy to Vercel**: Push to main branch for automatic deployment
5. **Post-Deployment Testing**: Verify all features work in production
6. **Monitor**: Check for any errors in Vercel/Supabase dashboards

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Authentication not working**: Check redirect URLs in Supabase settings
- **Database connection errors**: Verify environment variables
- **Profile not creating**: Check RLS policies and trigger function
- **Styling issues**: Verify Tailwind CSS is properly configured

### Debug Resources
- Vercel deployment logs
- Supabase real-time database logs
- Browser console for client-side errors
- Network tab for API request debugging
