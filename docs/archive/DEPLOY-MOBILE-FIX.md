# Deploy Mobile Guide Navigation Fix

**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Fix Applied**: ✅ Middleware exclusion for `/guide` route  
**Status**: Ready to deploy and test

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### The Problem
- **Android Chrome**: After login, clicking "Guide" button redirected to `/auth/login` instead of showing guide
- **Desktop Chrome**: Worked perfectly
- **Root cause**: Middleware auth check failed on mobile due to cookie timing issues during navigation

### The Solution  
**File changed**: `middleware.ts` (line 21)

**What changed**: Added `|guide` to the middleware exclusion pattern

```diff
- "/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|api/|auth/confirm|auth/callback|auth/error|wallet|root|tezos|apechain|avalanche|stacks|flow|.*\\.(?:svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp)$).*)"
+ "/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|api/|auth/confirm|auth/callback|auth/error|wallet|root|tezos|apechain|avalanche|stacks|flow|guide|.*\\.(?:svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp)$).*)"
```

**Why this is safe**:
- `/guide` page already has its own server-side auth check
- Shows `<GuideLockedView />` if not authenticated
- No security risk - auth still enforced at page level
- Removes redundant middleware check that breaks on mobile

## 🚀 Deploy to Production

### Option 1: Git Push (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/garrettair/Documents/vercel-supabase-web3
git add middleware.ts
git commit -m "fix: exclude /guide from middleware to fix mobile navigation redirect"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy from the `main` branch.

### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
cd /Users/garrettair/Documents/vercel-supabase-web3
vercel --prod --yes
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Desktop (macOS Chrome) - Should Still Work ✅
1. [ ] Go to devdapp.com
2. [ ] Login with test account
3. [ ] Profile loads
4. [ ] Click "Guide" → guide loads (authenticated view)
5. [ ] Logout
6. [ ] Visit `/guide` directly → shows locked view

### Mobile (Android Chrome) - SHOULD NOW WORK ✅
1. [ ] Go to devdapp.com on Android Chrome
2. [ ] Login with test account
3. [ ] Profile loads
4. [ ] Click "Guide" button
5. [ ] **SHOULD NOW LOAD GUIDE** (not redirect to login!)
6. [ ] Logout
7. [ ] Visit `/guide` directly → shows locked view

### Other Pages - No Regression ✅
1. [ ] `/protected/profile` still requires auth
2. [ ] `/avalanche`, `/flow`, etc. still work (already excluded)
3. [ ] `/auth/login` still works
4. [ ] Logout still works

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix
- ✅ Desktop: Login → Profile → Guide (works)
- ❌ Mobile: Login → Profile → Guide (redirects to login)

### After Fix
- ✅ Desktop: Login → Profile → Guide (works)
- ✅ Mobile: Login → Profile → Guide (NOW WORKS!)

## 🔍 Verification

### If It Works
You should see:
- Mobile navigation to `/guide` loads the guide page
- No redirect to `/auth/login`
- Authenticated users see full guide content
- Unauthenticated users see locked view

### If It Doesn't Work
Check:
1. Deployment successful? (check Vercel dashboard)
2. Cache cleared? (hard refresh browser)
3. Still logged in? (check profile page first)
4. Check browser console for errors

## 📝 Summary

**Changed**: 1 file (`middleware.ts`)  
**Lines changed**: 1 line (added `|guide` to exclusion pattern)
