    ├── wallet/   # CDP operations
    └── payment/  # x402 validation
```

### **Domain Configuration Required**
```javascript
// next.config.ts additions needed
{
  basePath: '/wallet',
  trailingSlash: true,
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/wallet/:path*',
        destination: '/:path*'

## 📝 Code Duplication Assessment

### **Analysis Limitations**
❌ **Cannot Complete Full Analysis**: x402-starter repository source code not accessible for direct comparison

### **Anticipated Duplication Areas**
Based on merge documentation references:

#### **Potential Overlap**
```
1. Authentication System
   Current: Supabase auth components
   x402: May have wallet-based auth
   Risk: Medium - different auth paradigms

2. UI Components  
   Current: shadcn/ui + Tailwind
   x402: Likely similar stack
   Risk: Low - component reuse possible

3. API Structure
   Current: Basic Next.js API routes
   x402: CDP and payment APIs
   Risk: Low - different purposes

4. Configuration
   Current: Supabase + Vercel config
   x402: CDP + AI service config
   Risk: Low - complementary configs
```

#### **Recommended Deduplication Strategy**
```
1. Component Library Consolidation
   ├── Merge UI components into shared library
   ├── Standardize on current design system
   └── Create component variants for different use cases

2. Authentication Strategy Alignment
   ├── Use Supabase as primary auth
   ├── Add wallet auth as secondary option
   └── Create unified auth context

3. API Architecture Unification
   ├── Organize by feature domain
   ├── Share common utilities
   └── Implement consistent error handling
```
