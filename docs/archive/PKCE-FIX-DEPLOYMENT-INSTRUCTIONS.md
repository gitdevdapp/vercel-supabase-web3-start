## üö® CRITICAL: Database Setup Required

**The PKCE authentication error will NOT be fixed until you run the database setup script.**

### Step 1: Execute Database Setup

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[REDACTED-PROJECT-ID]
2. **Navigate to**: SQL Editor
3. **Copy and paste** the entire contents of `scripts/enhanced-database-setup.sql`
4. **Click "Run"** to execute the script
5. **Verify success** by checking that the script shows "‚úÖ SUCCESS: All users have profiles!"

### Step 2: Verify Database Tables

After running the script, check that these tables exist:
- `auth.users` (should be automatically created by Supabase)
- `profiles` (created by our script)

You should no longer see "No tables created yet" in the Supabase dashboard.

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Test 1: New User Signup
1. Go to https://devdapp.com/auth/sign-up
2. Create a new account with a real email address
3. Check your email for the confirmation link
4. Click the confirmation link
5. **Expected**: Should redirect to `/protected/profile` without PKCE errors

### Test 2: Profile System
1. After successful signup, you should see the profile page
2. **Expected**: Profile shows default values (username from email, default bio/about_me)
3. Click "Edit Profile" to test the enhanced form
4. **Expected**: All fields (username, full name, bio, about me, profile picture, public toggle) work

### Test 3: Authentication Flow
1. Log out and log back in
2. **Expected**: Smooth login without authentication errors
3. Visit `/protected/profile` while logged in
4. **Expected**: Profile page loads with your data
