### Homepage content and UX fixes (2025-09-12)

This document summarizes the requested prompt and the exact changes implemented in the codebase to keep a permanent, auditable record.

### Goals from the prompt
- **Update schedule link**: Change all “Schedule a Call” links to the new Calendly URL with a hyphen: [calendly.com/git-devdapp](https://calendly.com/git-devdapp).
- **Reduce blank space**: The rotating blockchain chain name in the hero had too much left/right padding; reduce the visible blank space per screenshot.
- **dApp capitalization consistency**: Replace instances of "Web3 Dapps" and "Web3 DApps" to the correct forms: "dApp" or "dApps" as appropriate.
- **Remove extra buttons**: Remove "Partner with DevDapp" and "View Foundation Benefits" buttons.
- **Safety**: Make these edits without style-framework changes or breaking changes.
- **Delivery**: Commit to remote `main` and ensure Vercel is updated.

### Code edits
- **Calendly URL (with hyphen)**
  - `components/hero.tsx`: Updated `Schedule a Call` button href to `https://calendly.com/git-devdapp`.
  - `components/final-cta-section.tsx`: Updated `Schedule a Call` button href to `https://calendly.com/git-devdapp`.

- **Reduce blank space around rotating chain name**
  - `components/hero.tsx`: Reduced the minimum width of the inline container from `min-w-[180px]` to `min-w-[120px]`. This trims excess blank space while keeping smooth transitions across chain names.

- **dApp capitalization consistency**
  - `components/how-it-works-section.tsx`: Heading updated from "Build Web3 DApps in 3 Simple Steps" to "Build Web3 dApps in 3 Simple Steps".
  - Search for literal "Web3 Dapps" turned up none in source; remaining occurrences in docs will be handled separately if needed.

- **Remove extra buttons from foundation section**
  - `components/foundation-section.tsx`: Removed the button group containing "Partner with DevDapp" and "View Foundation Benefits".
  - Removed now-unused `Button` import in the same file.

### Non-functional constraints verified
- No dependency or framework changes were introduced.
- Only localized content/markup edits and a single Tailwind utility change (`min-w-[120px]`).
- Linter check passed on modified components with no new issues.

### Deployment
- Changes committed and pushed to `main`:
  - Commit: `f434098` — "Fix homepage content and styling" (includes the edits above and documentation housekeeping).
- Vercel is set to auto-deploy from GitHub; pushing to `main` triggers a production build. If manual trigger is ever needed, use the Vercel dashboard for this project.

### Visual/UX impact
- The hero’s rotating blockchain name now occupies less horizontal space, matching the screenshot guidance while avoiding layout shift.
- CTA links now point to the correct Calendly endpoint: [Calendly scheduling link](https://calendly.com/git-devdapp).
- Headings use consistent "dApp/dApps" capitalization.
- Foundation section is simplified by removing the two non-essential buttons.

### Follow-ups (optional)
- If further tightening of chain name spacing is desired, adjust `min-w` in `components/hero.tsx` (e.g., `min-w-[100px]`) after a quick visual check across common viewports.
- Audit documentation pages for any remaining "Web3 DApps/Dapps" occurrences and normalize phrasing if required.
