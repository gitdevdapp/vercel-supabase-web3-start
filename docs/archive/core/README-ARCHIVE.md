## 📋 Why These Files Are Archived

### Original Problem
The original core documentation suffered from:

1. **Content Duplication**: Same deployment steps repeated across 5 files
2. **Inconsistent Instructions**: Different approaches and configurations  
3. **Fragmented User Experience**: Users needed to read multiple documents
4. **Maintenance Issues**: Updates required in multiple places
5. **Conflicting Information**: Some docs contradicted others
