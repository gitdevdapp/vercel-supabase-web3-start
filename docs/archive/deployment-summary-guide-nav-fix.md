## 🔍 Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Immediate Checks (Next 30 minutes)
- [ ] Verify Vercel build completes successfully
- [ ] Check production deployment URL
- [ ] Test navigation at 900px breakpoint
- [ ] Test with zoom at 110%, 125%, 150%
- [ ] Verify mobile view (< 900px)
- [ ] Check desktop sidebar (≥ 900px)

### Short-term Monitoring (Next 24 hours)
- [ ] Monitor error logs (should be zero)
- [ ] Check user session recordings
- [ ] Verify bounce rate on /guide
- [ ] Monitor support tickets
- [ ] Review browser analytics (viewport widths)

### Long-term Success Metrics (Next 7 days)
- [ ] Guide completion rate (expect increase)
- [ ] Time to complete guide (expect decrease)
- [ ] Navigation visibility rate (expect 99.5%+)
- [ ] User satisfaction scores

## 🛠️ Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### Option 1: Quick Revert
```bash
git revert 344fee0
git push origin main
```
**Time to rollback:** ~2 minutes  
**Vercel auto-deploys:** ~3 minutes  
**Total downtime:** ~5 minutes

### Option 2: Adjust Breakpoint
If 900px causes issues, adjust to:
- **1024px (lg):** More conservative, hides sidebar earlier
- **768px (md):** Previous setting, known issues
- **Custom value:** Fine-tune as needed

### Option 3: Disable Custom Breakpoint
Remove nav breakpoint, use standard Tailwind breakpoints

## 📝 Key Takeaways

### What Worked Well
1. **Thorough root cause analysis** identified zoom/DevTools issues
2. **Mathematical verification** ensured proper spacing
3. **Comprehensive testing** covered edge cases
4. **Progressive enhancement** maintained functionality
5. **Clear documentation** for future reference

### Technical Insights
1. Browser zoom affects viewport calculations significantly
2. Custom breakpoints are acceptable when justified
3. Mobile-first approach provides better fallbacks
4. DevTools reduces viewport (must account for this)
5. 900px sweet spot balances desktop/mobile needs

### Process Improvements
1. Always test with multiple zoom levels
2. Consider DevTools impact on viewport
3. Verify layout math before implementation
4. Document reasoning for custom breakpoints
5. Build comprehensive verification checklist
