# Vercel Deployment Cache Issue

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Problem**: Guide UI fixes are in code but NOT showing on production  
**Root Cause**: Vercel build cache or CDN cache

---

## Confirmed Facts

### ✅ Code Is Correct
```bash
# Fixes ARE in the repository
git show 95e54bf:components/guide/StepSection.tsx | grep "break-words"
# OUTPUT: break-words overflow-hidden [&>*]:break-words [&_code]:break-all

git show origin/main:components/guide/StepSection.tsx | grep "break-words"  
# OUTPUT: break-words overflow-hidden [&>*]:break-words [&_code]:break-all
```

### ✅ Commits Are Pushed
```bash
git log origin/main --oneline -3
# f7e709e chore: trigger Vercel redeploy for guide UI/UX fixes
# 95e54bf fix(guide): improve UI/UX with text wrapping, scroll tracking
# 9120c53 Replace View Demo button with Source Code
```

### ❌ Production NOT Updated
- Text still not wrapping at 320px
- Scroll tracking still broken
- Multiple redeployments haven't fixed it

---

## Likely Causes

### 1. Vercel Build Cache (Most Likely)
Vercel caches `.next` build output between deployments. Even with code changes, it might reuse cached components.

### 2. CDN Edge Cache
Vercel's CDN might be serving cached HTML/CSS/JS even though new build completed.

### 3. Browser Cache (Unlikely)
User's browser caching old assets. Hard refresh should fix this.

### 4. Wrong Branch Deployment
Vercel might be deploying from a different branch than `main`.

## Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Force Fresh Build (Recommended)

Go to Vercel Dashboard:
1. Select your project
2. Settings → General
3. Scroll to "Build & Development Settings"
4. Click "Redeploy" 
5. **Check "Use existing Build Cache" - UNCHECK THIS BOX**
6. Click "Redeploy"

This forces Vercel to rebuild everything from scratch.

### Solution 2: Clear CDN Cache

```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Deployments
# 2. Find latest deployment (f7e709e)
# 3. Click ... menu → Purge Cache
```

### Solution 3: Environment Variable Trick

Add a dummy environment variable to force rebuild:
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
# Add: FORCE_REBUILD=1
# Then: Redeploy
```

### Solution 4: Delete and Recreate Deployment

Nuclear option:
```bash
# 1. Go to Vercel project settings
# 2. Scroll to bottom → Delete Project
# 3. Re-import from GitHub
# This forces 100% fresh deployment
```

### Solution 5: Check Branch Configuration

```bash
# Verify Vercel is deploying from main:
# 1. Settings → Git
# 2. Production Branch should be "main"
# 3. If not, change it and redeploy
```

## Diagnostic Commands

### Check What Vercel Actually Deployed

```bash
# Get the deployed build info
curl -s https://[your-vercel-url].vercel.app/api/debug/build-info

# Check if source maps exist (indicates fresh build)
curl -I https://[your-vercel-url].vercel.app/_next/static/chunks/[chunk].js.map
```

### Verify Build Logs

```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard:
# 1. Deployments → Latest deployment
# 2. Click "View Function Logs"
# 3. Check for:
#    - "Creating an optimized production build"
#    - "Compiled successfully"
#    - Any cache messages
```

---

## Expected vs Actual

### Expected Behavior
After deployment, visiting `/guide` should show:
- Text wrapping at 320px width (no horizontal scroll)
- Active step indicator working for all 14 steps
- Completed checkmarks appearing

### Actual Behavior  
Visiting `/guide` shows:
- ❌ Horizontal scroll on mobile
- ❌ Scroll tracking frozen after step 3-4
- Multiple redeployments haven't changed anything

---

## Next Steps

1. **Try Solution 1** (Force fresh build without cache)
2. **Wait 3-5 minutes** for deployment
3. **Hard refresh browser** (Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Test at 320px width**

If still broken after fresh build:
- Check Vercel build logs for errors
- Verify correct branch is deployed
- Try Solution 4 (nuclear option)
