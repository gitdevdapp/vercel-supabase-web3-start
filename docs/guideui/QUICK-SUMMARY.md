# Quick Summary: Why Guide Changes Aren't Showing

**TL;DR**: Your code is perfect. Vercel is stuck serving a cached build.

## The Facts

✅ **Code IS Fixed**
- Text wrapping: ✅ In code
- Scroll tracking: ✅ In code  
- All committed to main: ✅ `95e54bf`
- Pushed to GitHub: ✅ Confirmed

❌ **Production NOT Updated**
- Vercel deployed multiple times
- Changes still not visible
- UI broken same way as before

## The Problem

**Vercel's `.next` build cache is persisting between deployments.**

Even when you redeploy, Vercel is reusing the cached build from BEFORE your fixes.

## The Fix

**Redeploy WITHOUT cache:**

1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Deployments → Latest → ⋮ Menu
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. **UNCHECK "Use existing Build Cache"** ← KEY!
5. Click Redeploy
6. Wait 3-5 minutes
7. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
8. Test at 320px width

## Test It Worked

✅ **No horizontal scroll at 320px**  
✅ **Active step indicator works for all 14 steps**

If both work → Fixed!  
If still broken → See `/docs/guideui/FIX-VERCEL-CACHE.md` for more options

---

**Bottom Line**: This is a Vercel caching issue, NOT a code issue.
