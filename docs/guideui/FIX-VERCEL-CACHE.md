# 🔧 Fix Vercel Cache Issue - Action Plan

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Problem**: Guide UI fixes are in code but Vercel keeps serving old cached version  
**Solution**: Force Vercel to rebuild without cache

---

## ✅ CONFIRMED: Code Is Correct

I verified the fixes ARE in your repository:

```bash
# Text wrapping fix - PRESENT ✅
git show origin/main:components/guide/StepSection.tsx | grep "break-words"
# Result: break-words overflow-hidden [&>*]:break-words [&_code]:break-all

# Scroll tracking fix - PRESENT ✅  
git show origin/main:components/guide/ProgressNav.tsx | grep "rootMargin"
# Result: rootMargin: '-30% 0px -30% 0px',

# Page layout fix - PRESENT ✅
git show origin/main:app/guide/page.tsx | grep "overflow-hidden"
# Result: className="w-full md:ml-80 pt-20 md:pt-16 px-0 overflow-hidden"
```

**All fixes are committed and pushed to production.**

---

## 🚨 THE ACTUAL PROBLEM

**Vercel is using a cached build from BEFORE your fixes.**

Even though you've:
- ✅ Committed fixes (95e54bf)
- ✅ Pushed to main
- ✅ Triggered redeployments  
- ✅ Created empty commit (f7e709e)

**Vercel's `.next` build cache is persisting between deployments.**

---

## 🔥 SOLUTION: Force Fresh Build (NO CACHE)

### Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Trigger Redeploy WITHOUT Cache**
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - Find latest deployment
   - Click ⋮ (three dots menu)
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - **IMPORTANT: Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"** ← This is the key!
   - Click "Redeploy" button

3. **Wait for Build** (3-5 minutes)
   - Watch build logs
   - Look for "Creating an optimized production build"
   - Should see all components compiling fresh

4. **Test After Deployment**
   - Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Visit /guide page
   - Resize to 320px width
   - Check: NO horizontal scroll ✅
   - Scroll through all 14 steps
   - Check: Active indicator updates ✅

---

### Option 2: Delete `.next` Cache via Environment Variable

If Option 1 doesn't work:

1. **Add Environment Variable**
   ```
   Settings → Environment Variables → Add New
   
   Name: NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED
   Value: 1
   Environments: Production, Preview, Development
   ```

2. **Trigger Redeploy**
   - This forces Next.js to recognize a config change
   - Should bypass cache

---

### Option 3: Change Build Command (Nuclear Option)

1. **Go to Project Settings**
   ```
   Settings → General → Build & Development Settings
   ```

2. **Override Build Command**
   ```
   Current: next build
   Change to: rm -rf .next && next build
   ```

3. **Save and Redeploy**
   - This will ALWAYS delete cache before building
   - Slower builds but guarantees fresh output

---

### Option 4: Create New Branch Deploy

Sometimes Vercel caches by branch. Force a fresh start:

```bash
# Create new branch from main
git checkout -b force-rebuild-guide-fixes

# Make tiny change to force new build
echo "\n// Force rebuild $(date)" >> next.config.ts

# Commit and push
git add next.config.ts
git commit -m "force: trigger fresh Vercel build without cache"
git push origin force-rebuild-guide-fixes

# In Vercel Dashboard:
# - Create new deployment from this branch
# - Set as Production if it works
# - Delete old branch deployment
```

---

## 🧪 HOW TO VERIFY IT WORKED

### Test 1: Text Wrapping
```
1. Open deployed site
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Resize to 320px width
4. Scroll through guide

PASS: No horizontal scroll at any point ✅
FAIL: Horizontal scroll appears ❌
```

### Test 2: Scroll Tracking
```
1. Desktop view
2. Slowly scroll from Step 1 → Step 14
3. Watch left sidebar progress indicator

PASS: Active step updates for ALL 14 steps ✅
       Checkmarks appear for completed steps ✅
FAIL: Indicator freezes after step 3-4 ❌
```

### Test 3: Inspect Element
```
1. Right-click any guide text
2. Inspect element
3. Look at computed styles

EXPECTED:
- overflow-wrap: anywhere ✅
- word-break: break-word ✅
- prose class with sm: and lg: variants ✅

If you see these styles → Build worked
If you DON'T see these → Still cached
```

## 🔍 DEBUGGING: If Still Broken

### Check 1: Verify What Vercel Built

In Vercel deployment logs, search for:

```
✓ Creating an optimized production build    
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types  
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (39/39)

# Look for this file being built:
.next/server/app/guide/page.js
```

If you see "Using existing build" anywhere → Cache wasn't cleared

### Check 2: Source Maps

```bash
# Check if fresh build generated new source maps
curl -I https://[your-url].vercel.app/_next/static/chunks/app/guide/page-[hash].js

# Look at Last-Modified header
# Should be TODAY's date if fresh build
```

### Check 3: Git SHA in Build

```bash
# Vercel should show which commit it built
# In deployment details, look for:
# "Built from commit: 95e54bf" or "f7e709e"

# If it shows older commit → Branch mismatch
```

## ⚙️ VERCEL SETTINGS TO CHECK

### Setting 1: Production Branch
```
Settings → Git → Production Branch
Should be: main ✅
If not: Change to main and redeploy
```

### Setting 2: Build Command
```
Settings → General → Build & Development Settings
Build Command: next build ✅
Output Directory: .next ✅
Install Command: npm install ✅
```

### Setting 3: Node Version
```
Settings → General → Node.js Version  
Should be: 20.x or 18.x ✅
If older: Update to latest LTS
```

### Setting 4: Framework Preset
```
Settings → General → Framework Preset
Should be: Next.js ✅
If "Other": Change to Next.js
```

## 📊 CHECKLIST

Before marking as fixed, verify ALL:

- [ ] Vercel redeployed WITHOUT build cache
- [ ] Build logs show "Creating an optimized production build"
- [ ] Build completed successfully (no errors)
- [ ] Hard refreshed browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
- [ ] No horizontal scroll at 320px width

## 🎯 EXPECTED TIMELINE

- **Option 1** (Redeploy without cache): 5 minutes
- **Option 2** (Environment variable): 10 minutes  
- **Option 3** (Change build command): 10 minutes
- **Option 4** (New branch): 15 minutes

**Start with Option 1. It should work.**

## 📝 WHAT TO TELL ME

After trying Option 1, report back:

1. Did you find "Use existing Build Cache" checkbox?
2. Did you UNCHECK it before redeploying?
3. What do the build logs say?
4. Does the test at 320px width work now?
5. Does scroll tracking work through all 14 steps?

If it's STILL broken after Option 1, we'll try Option 2-4.
